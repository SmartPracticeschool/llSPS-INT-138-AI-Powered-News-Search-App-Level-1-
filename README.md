Hello everyone!


I am Raesah Sheriff


This contains the details of project that was launched by SmartBridge in association with AICTE.
My project titled AI Powered News Search App is a Server Side Application made using Node-RED using the pre-built Watson Discovery News collection and Watson Discovery Service through the Discovery API. Optionally,I have also chosen to use a Slack interface to query the data, push news alerts out to web notification and deploy the app on IBM Cloud.

The purpose of the project is to improve news fetching methodologies. The briefing tool of IBM watson discovery extracts text data from different sources and the clustering feature allows users to organize data and generate topics. I also used sentiment analysis that helps to learn how a bot uses artificial intelligence approach to provide customer insight on a massive scale.

This project includes a bot like a Slack App designed to interact with users via conversation but with a face,name and a personality that encourages users to converse.

2.1 Existing problem

1)It is difficult to rely on search engines to index, sort and rank externally-produced content.

2)There should be constant organizing of the content.

3)The news content has to sort through local to find local news. 
 
coming to the most important point, how true is the news

4)It is difficult to get better quality news.


All of these problems are overcomed by the use of Watson Discovery Service:

This project used an experiment of using Watson Discovery continually crawls into the web to update its Discovery News collection to query news and display it to the user via UI and a slack bot. 

This project experimented with cognitical solution that can deliver immediate insight with great precision and a remarkable level of detail. It offers qualitative data about people’s opinions and feelings. The solution processes huge amounts of structured and unstructured data. The process is automated, so it’s fast. To compile a similar sentiment analysis report manually it would take approximately a week, and by that time, the data would be old. Cognitical include solutions that evaluate sarcasm, satire and emotion.
