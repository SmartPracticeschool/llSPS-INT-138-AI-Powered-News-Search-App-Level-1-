Hello everyone!


I am Raesah Sheriff


This repository contains the details of project that was launched by SmartBridge in association with AICTE.
My project titled AI Powered News Search App is a Server Side Application made using Node-RED using the pre-built Watson Discovery News collection and Watson Discovery Service through the Discovery API. Optionally,I have also chosen to use a Slack interface to query the data, push news alerts out to web notification and deploy the app on IBM Cloud.

The purpose of the project is to improve news fetching methodologies. The briefing tool of IBM watson discovery extracts text data from different sources and the clustering feature allows users to organize data and generate topics. I also used sentiment analysis that helps to learn how a bot uses artificial intelligence approach to provide customer insight on a massive scale.

This project includes a bot like a Slack App designed to interact with users via conversation but with a face,name and a personality that encourages users to converse.

Existing problem

1)It is difficult to rely on search engines to index, sort and rank externally-produced content.

2)There should be constant organizing of the content.

3)The news content has to sort through local to find local news. 
 
coming to the most important point, how true is the news

4)It is difficult to get better quality news.

Recommended solution through my app,All of these problems are overcomed by the use of Watson Discovery Service:

This project used an experiment of using Watson Discovery continually crawls into the web to update its Discovery News collection to query news and display it to the user via UI and a slack bot. 

This project experimented with cognitical solution that can deliver immediate insight with great precision and a remarkable level of detail. It offers qualitative data about people’s opinions and feelings. The solution processes huge amounts of structured and unstructured data. The process is automated, so it’s fast. To compile a similar sentiment analysis report manually it would take approximately a week, and by that time, the data would be old. Cognitical include solutions that evaluate sarcasm, satire and emotion.

This project includes a bot it is the same as a regular app: it can access the same range of APIs and do all of the magical things that a Slack App can do. A bot is a type of Slack App designed to interact with users via conversation. But when you build a bot for your Slack App, you're giving that app a face, a name, and a personality and encouraging users to talk to it.

The bot can send DMs, it can be mentioned by users, it can post messages or upload files, and it can be invited to channels - or kicked out. Since bot is capable of doing everything that a Slack App can do, we're going to limit our focus to a common use-case for bots.
